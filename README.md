# InstAndroid
An Instagram clone we did in 2020 for the subject Software Development Project.
An Android application that consumes a REST API. This applications is meant to be used with the [InstaSpring](https://github.com/sergiMagret/insta_server_copy_pds) backend. It is a simple app that uses the following technologies:

(All of the following technologies was given to us by the teacher so all the groups would start with the same basic app, the base application can be found in [TODOAndroid](https://github.com/neich/TODOAndroid))
- Compiled for Android API 27, minimum API 23
- Uses [Retrofit](http://square.github.io/retrofit/) to consume the API
- Uses [OkHttp3](http://square.github.io/okhttp/) as http client
- Uses persistent cookies with [PersistentCookieJar](https://github.com/franmontiel/PersistentCookieJar)

This application and the [server](https://github.com/sergiMagret/insta_server_copy_pds) do not intend to make any profit or steal any technology or software owned by Instagram, it was just for learning purposes.
